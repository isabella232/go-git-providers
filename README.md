# go-git-providers

`go-git-providers` is a library that contains Go clients for different Git providers like Github.

At the moment only Github operations regarding deploy keys are supported.

**Warning**: The APIs contained in this repo are very unstable as it is very early to define a good interface that will work well
    for most providers.
